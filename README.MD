**Project Goal:** Cartwise is an emerging e-commerce start-up company that aims to provide a frictionless shopping experience. We envision
becoming one of the leading e-commerce platforms that delivers a seamless and data-driven shopping experience. Our
strategy includes a phased approach, where the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on building the core
functions essential for an online store â€“ product listings, customer accounts, shopping carts, order management, and
payment processing. These foundational capabilities will ensure a stable and scalable platform, setting the stage for future
growth.

As Cartwise evolves, future initiatives (not in scope) will address critical challenges in online retail, such as cart
abandonment, inefficient inventory management, and fragmented customer data. Long-term, our vision includes leveraging
customer interactions for personalized & rewarding shopping experiences, implementing real-time inventory optimization,
enhancing the checkout process to reduce drop-offs, and using advanced analytics for data-driven decision-making. By
establishing a robust database infrastructure, Cartwise aims to support these innovations, ensuring long-term scalability,
operational efficiency, and enhanced customer engagement.
