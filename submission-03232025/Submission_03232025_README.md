# Submission on March 23, 2025

- Along with the SQL script file, the markdown files (named README.md and PRODUCT_README.md) provide high-level documentation of our project.

- We have marked contributors with an @Author tag against each section.
- All the sections are numbered using format: `"<Type Of Script> <Serial Number Within the Script Type>"`. For example Table 1, Table 2, Query 1, Query 2, Insert 1, Insert 2, Function 1, Function2, Index 1, Index 2 etc.
- This is a work in progress submission. Hence, we have added TODO tags for any upcoming work we have planned so far.
- The submission contains 16 tables, insert scripts for all tables, 12 complex queries. Besides, we have also created some functions and indexes although they weren't strictly required for this submission. The GitHub repository for our project is:
